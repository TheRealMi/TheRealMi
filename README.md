# 🌈 What's up everybody? I'm Mia! 🌈 

# My Focus 🧠
I like to think of myself as a "renaissance woman" or "Jill of all Trades" if you will; while I love working on full-stack development, I will always put my focus on the user experience no matter where my work resides within the file structure of the project. My projects have all been built upon my own areas of interest while taking the time to pay attention to utility and practicality for the users. 

# My Background 🎮🦊
I have always been drawn to tech. From founding a nationally competitive robotics club in high-school, to taking elective courses in Python and Game Development in college, to implementing systems to aid in my original career field of Animal Science, the tech field has forever remained relevant to me. In 2018 I graduated from Cornell University with a B.S. in Animal Science, and I worked in that field for about 6 years before realizing I needed a change. Now, I seek to bring my background, skills, and passions to a new career path in software engineering.
